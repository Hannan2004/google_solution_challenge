## Overview

The Water Health Predictor is an artificial intelligence-based system designed to predict water health, aiding in the early detection of contamination and ensuring water safety. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes diverse data sources, including environmental factors and historical patterns, to provide accurate and timely insights into the health of water sources.

Our solution is aligned with UN Sustainable Goal 6, which focuses on clean water and sanitation, contributing to global efforts to achieve water-related sustainability.

## Features

- **Early Contamination Detection:** Utilizes AI to detect potential water contamination issues early on.
- **Accurate Insights:** Analyzes diverse data sources to provide accurate and timely insights into water health.
- **UN Sustainable Goal 6:** Aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 for clean water and sanitation.
